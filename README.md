This is a note taking app.
It is a personal project to improve my front-end development skills.
Backend is also deployed - one using mongoDB and another using postgreSQL.

Currently, basic functionalities are implemented and I am improving CSS and add more functionalities.

### Tech Stack Rationale

#### Front End

**Solution:** React, React Router, Redux (planed to add Styled Components, Semantic UI, Firebase Oauth)

- Organizes state and manages front-end part of the project, reduces need for page reloads during navigation
- Routing links
- DOM Manipulation
- Reusable components
- Performance
- Documentation and ease-of-use/implementation

#### Back End

**Solution:** Node, Express

- JavaScript on the front and back end
- Reduces server-side logic complexity -> faster development
- Minimalist and un-opinionated framework
- Performance and cross-platform coverage

#### Database

**Solution:** SQLite for dev and PostgreSQL for prod, Knex

- Structured schemas to define data
- Relationships between data
- Spread data across tables
- Able to query tables

### Front-end URLs
